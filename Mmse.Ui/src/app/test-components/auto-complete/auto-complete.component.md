# AutoComplete

## What is It?
AutoComplete works like a normal input with a list of suggested options that filter as the user types.

## Usage Guidelines
A common use case might be something like a search box where you would want to suggest common search parameters as the user types.   Another case would be a lengthy list of options too long for a standard select -- like a list of users in an organization.

## Additional Documentation
This sample shows a common use case for an AutoComplete.  For additional options and documentation, see the [Angular Material documentation](https://material.angular.io/components/autocomplete/overview).
