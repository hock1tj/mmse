# Select

## What is It?
Select controls are used for displaying lists of options. You can allow for single or multiple selections.

## Usage Guidelines
Select controls can be used for any form question that allows for the selection of one or more options.  For binary True/False or Yes/No options consider a checkbox instead.  For small numbers of mutually exclusive options, consider a radio button.

## Additional Documentation
