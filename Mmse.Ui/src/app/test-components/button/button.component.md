# Button

## Usage Guidelines
### Basic (Flat) Button 
Basic or Flat Buttons are primarily used in dialogs, but can also be inline in cases where you do not need the button to be very prominent.

### Raised Button
Raised buttons are used inline within the app and should be used in cases where the button needs to be more prominent.  

### Icon Button
Icon buttons are best used in a toolbar, and the icon should clearly indicate the button's function.

### Floating Action Button
Floating Action Buttons are used to promote a common, primary action for a UI.  Material Design guidlines recommend limiting to one Floating Action Button per screen.

### Mini Floating Action Button
Mini Floating Action Buttons can be used in conjunction with a normal Floating Action Button, in which the main FAB when clicked shows mini-FAB options.  Should limit to no more than 6 on a screen.
