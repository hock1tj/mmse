# Progress Bar

## What is It?
Progress Bar is a animated horizontal bar used to show the user that either some server-side processing is taking place or to show user progress through a series of steps.

## Usage Guidelines
Progress bars have four modes -- Determinate, Indeterminate, Buffer, and Query.  See Angular Material docs for usage guidelines on Buffer and Query.  Determinate and Inderminate are the more commonly used modes.

### Indeterminate
This is a looping animation to show that some server-side processing is taking place within the context of a component -- a file upload, for instance.

### Determinate
This shows a percentage-based progress of something -- either something being loaded from the server or user progress though multiple steps through part of an application.

## Additional Documentation
This sample shows a common use case for a Progress Bar.  For additional options and documentation, see the [Angular Material documentation](https://material.angular.io/components/progress-bar/overview).
