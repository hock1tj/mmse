# List

## What is It?
Lists provide a way to display a repeating list of small content on a page.

## Usage Guidelines
Lists should be used to display repeating, homogenous small chunks of content.  For larger bits of content, Cards should be used.  For image based content, use a grid list instead.  Lists can also be Selection Lists, which allow the user to select the row of content.

## Additional Documentation
For additional options and documentation, see the [Angular Material documentation](https://material.angular.io/components/list/overview).
