# Button Toggle

## What is it?
Button Toggle is a button that works similarly to a checkbox with an active and inactive state.

## Usage Guidelines
In general, Button Toggles are not a replacement for checkboxes or radio buttons in a form.  They should be used in a toolbar.

### Single Button 
Similar to a checkbox, this would be used to toggle between two binary states.

### Button Toggle Group
This would work similarly to a radio button, where a user can select between a group of toggles.  Toggles can be mutually exclusive or you can allow for multiple selection.
