# Dialog (Modal)

## What is it?
A Dialog is floating panel that pop's up over the UI and requires the user to perform an action before moving on.

## Usage Guidlines
Dialogs can be used to get confirmation for a potentially destructive action (e.g. "Are you sure you want to delete this record?") or get additional user input after clicking on an action button.

## Note
Dialog actually required the use of two components -- MatDialog, which calls the dialog, and MatDialogRef which contains the content of the dialog
