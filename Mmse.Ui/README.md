## Angular CLI

* You can add new components and services programmatically with Angular CLI. Open command prompt and type....
	* To generate service "ng generate service services/YourServiceName"
	* To generate component "ng generate component components/YourComponentName". You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
	* This will generate .ts and .spec.ts files for you in both cases. For components, it will also generate html and css files.
	* Full docs at : https://cli.angular.io/
