# Mmse.Ui

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Angular CLI

* You can add new components and services programmatically with Angular CLI. Open command prompt and type....
	* To generate service "ng generate service services/YourServiceName"
	* To generate component "ng generate component components/YourComponentName". You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
	* This will generate .ts and .spec.ts files for you in both cases. For components, it will also generate html and css files.
	* Full docs at : https://cli.angular.io/
  * You can also get more help on the Angular CLI by using `ng help` or checking out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Node.js

Must have latest version of Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/en/) -- version 8.11.1 is good.

## Build

* To build and run project
  * Restore NuGet Packages on Solution
  * Open command prompt 
    * Type "npm install" (This will build your node_modules folder and get all your dependencies and typings)
      * There's at least one package that will need to be deleted from the installed angular stuff - browser(something)
  * Type "npm run dist" (This will compile Angular code. Use instead of ng serve as it moves code to web project)
  * At this point, you should be able to build and debug project
  * The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.  
	* Then for continuous build, type "npm run serve"
  * To start up Jest for TDD, again open command prompt and type "npm run test"
  * To build for production, open command prompt and type "npm run dist:prod"
